<b>Epic Legends of the Magic Sword Kings</b><br>
<br>
<font size='5'>Setting</font><br>
The year is 35 <a href='http://elothtesphalla.pbwiki.com/TMSK'>TMSK</a>.  It is a time of great change for <a href='http://elothtesphalla.pbwiki.com/Battal'>Battal</a>.  United as one for the first time in human memory, all the lands are under the reign of <b>King Ronard</b>.  The engines of wealth and power are turning, and great works are under way, but not all is at peace in the lands.  The mighty <a href='http://elothtesphalla.pbwiki.com/twelve realms'>twelve realms</a> of Battal, allied under King Ronard, are at constant odds with one another as they vie for power and influence within the new world order.  Espionage, trade disputes, minor military skirmishes and assassinations are all too common.  It is the <a href='http://elothtesphalla.pbwiki.com/Kings Council'>Kings Council</a>, the council of each of the <a href='http://elothtesphalla.pbwiki.com/Magic Sword Kings'>Magic Sword Kings</a> of the individual twelve realms, that must resolve these disputes; holding together the patchwork alliances that maintain the fragile peace.<br>
<br>
<font size='5'>The Story</font><br>
One of the great public works commissioned by <b>King Ronard</b> is the exploration and mapping of the <a href='http://elothtesphalla.pbwiki.com/FaeriWraithe Lands'>FaeriWraithe Lands</a>, a recently discovered plane of Battal with potentially vast untapped riches and natural resources.  A meeting of the Kings Council has been called in order to decide on the details of funding and organizing such an expedition.  Each of the kings of the twelve realms arrives in <b>Mandleclang</b> with their retinue in tow and the council of kings begins to meet immediately in the Chamber of the Kings.<br>
<br>
It soon becomes apparent that <i>someone</i> or <i>something</i> would like this undertaking to fail.  After a delegate from <b>Blee</b> turned up dead, it was thought to be a spot of bad luck.  When a representative from the <b>Kingdom of Parsonya</b> was found dead in his chambers, it was an eerie coincidence.  By the time all of the delegates from <b>Morlond's Field</b> had been slipped poison in their soup (although they may have done this to themselves).  Slowly the delegates were whittled away, and the local Mandleclang authorities were unable to discover the culprits.  By the time there were only two delegates remaining from each of the realms, they were unable to wait any longer and ready to take matters into their own hands.  Suspicions run high, as well as nationalistic pride and xenophobic prejudice.  Alliances form and tonight, vigilante justice would be dispensed.<br>
<br>
<font size='5'>Phalla Rules</font><br>
There will be delegates from each of the realms except for Morlond's Field (but including Portund).<br>
<br>
Each night the delegates will vote on which one of their number is an assassin and they will execute him/her.  The assassins will also pick a delegate to assassinate.<br>
<br>
Hidden among the delegates:<br>
* 1 seer (details to be revealed)<br>
* 1 guardian (details to be revealed)<br>
* some assassins advancing the agenda of <b>Evil</b><br>
<br>
<font size='4'>Additional Votes</font><br>
Additionally, every true delegate has a certain amount of sway with their King, who in turn has a certain amount of sway over all the delegates. Once per game, each delegate (non-seer,non-guardian,non-assassin) can use their influence with their king to have the king cast a vote for the assassination... essentially giving the player two votes for that day. A king may only cast one vote per day, determined randomly from the votes from player's from that king's faction. Make your king vote like this: <b><font color='black'>!King Vote &lt;name&gt;</font></b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size='3'>Victory Conditions</font><br>
<b>Good</b>: In the end, as long as at least one delegate remains, the council will continue to meet, ultimately resulting in a band of explorers being send to the Faeriwraithe Lands.<br>
<b>Evil</b>: If only evil delegates (assassins disguised as delegates) remain, the evil delegates will have the sole ear of the kings and they will convince the kings that the venture is cursed.  Whatever nefarious forces have set this plot into motion will be successful.<br>

That'd be much better.<br>
Except that the etc. (which I assume means that the mod would create a custom pro-town or anti-town role) would require that the mod also set the mechanics manually: as opposed to set roles, like the vig, for instance, whose kill is automatically delivered through internet magic that is too complicated for me to comprehend, a custom role wouldn't automatically get the night choice done. Which means that every time we think of a role we might use that has different operating mechanics than any available roles, we have to run to WC to create a role for us. Tiresome, for all of us.<br>
<br>
I'm also thinking, WC, if we could have the already available roles (seer, observer etc.) renamed if the mod wants to. I mean not centrally, but give every mod the option of giving custom names to stock roles. To me personally, coming from MS, it's unnerving and confusing to have the cop called seer and the watcher (I assume) called observer.

First thing that comes to mind is a wider variety of roles available.  Description is the only thing that really allows mod to add full flavor to the game (ie themed games).

613,"A mayoral invitation, amazing.  You never expected to hear from the great Mayor Pika of Pikadopolas, but when you got home the answering machine explained it all.  You were one of the chosen few that he wanted to talk to, in order to fix a social issue in the city, how you qualified for that position or what it was you never will know.  High school was rough and you barely got out of there, and for the last few years you had been working at the local Taco Bell.<br>
<br>
Arriving at the city hall you walked up the front stairs, eager to save the town.  Down the great hall you enter conference room C and are surprised to see the room has seven other people already waiting inside.  Taking a seat at the only open chair left at the end of a long table, you start small talk with the others.<br>
<br>
Why are you here?  What will you be doing?  People bring up the economic depression, the alarming school dropout rate, the corruption in city hall (not from Mayor Pika).  Eventually though the doors swing open and in walked Mayor Pika<br>
<br>
A sight to be seen indeed, tall and thin with short, spiked black hair.  What made the scene though was his bright yellow suit and slacks.  A few people giggled to themselves as he walked by, and you wonder how someone like him had ever been appointed mayor in the first place.  Little did you know he was a master debater, and had the ability to sway and individual with a few choice words, still, a sight to be seen though.<br>
<br>
“Citizens,” he begins as he takes his spot at the table head, “We have a problem in this city, and as you know, its election season.”<br>
<br>
Groans rose from the table, you start daydreaming, “Im not even registered to vote” you think.<br>
<br>
“I know you are all excited about the debates, I know I am,” Mayor Pika droaned on “but I need to nip a problem we have before these debates even begin.  That’s the problem with the mafia that have invaded the town.”<br>
<br>
“Yeah how bout that?” You yell, “What do we look like, the freakin cops?”<br>
<br>
“No no my friend,” says the Mayor, grinning slightly “I already talked to the cops, and they had a lot of information for me.  They never were able to figure who the mafia members are, but they did figure out there were two of them.”<br>
<br>
You didn’t like where this was going, looking around the table you apparently weren’t the only one.<br>
<br>
Now breaking into a full smile the Mayor continues “Two of you are mafia, we just don’t know who.  Now instead of deciding this in a civil manor, we are going to let you duke it out yourself”  Mayor Pika starts heading for the door.  “Under that table is a length of strong rope, and that big beam up there, that should hold the weight of a human body.”<br>
<br>
The table erupts in conversation as he reaches the door, he stops, and turns his head slightly. “I expect to see a body every night, you should expect to see one every morning.”<br>
<br>
The door snaps shut, and you hear chains and a padlock click on the other side.  Everyone around the table stares at each other.  Who are you gunna kill?<br>

635,"All delegates placed their vote into the <i>Deciding Cup</i> and the votes were tallied.  It was agreed.

His dark style of dress and pre-occupation with death didn't help his odds either.<br>
<br>
This alone was enough to convict among this paranoid and frightened group.  In accordance with <a href='http://elothtes.pbwiki.com/Law+269'>Law 268</a>, Korts was put to death in the usual way... <i>by item</i> (in this case it was a large blunt instrument).<br>

The sad truth for the delegates though, is that some Kelembadians <i>just can't sing</i>, and Ace was guilty of nothing more than a beady eyes and a club foot.  In the morning, Ace's body was found in the voting chamber, eyes staring wide, a look of abject terror on his face, body unnaturally pale, but not a mark on it.  A victim of the assassins, it was clear he has seen something just before death that was so horrible and evil that the shock alone has been the death of him.<br>
<br>
Servants report seeing to cloaked figures leaving the antechamber close to dawn.  <i>Two</i>... So Korts had been innocent.  Well, as innocent as anyone who dwells so close to the shadows of the <i>Chasm of Eternal Sorrow</i> could possibly be; certainly no assassin.<br>

Now six delegates remain, and another day of deliberation begins.  Ace had been another innocent.  Clearly judging solely on appearance was not going to be the way to ensure success in this most deadly situation.<br>
