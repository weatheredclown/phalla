# Documentation Guidelines for 1989 Coverage

- Keep `movie-coverage.md` aligned with the current set of cabinets in `madia.new/public/secret/1989/`.
  - Add a new row to the coverage table whenever you ship or rename a cabinet.
  - Update the "Remaining Targets" list after every new addition so it continues to reflect the unreleased top-50 films.
