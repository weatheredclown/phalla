# Documentation Guidelines for 1989 Coverage

- ðŸš« `movie-coverage.md` is currently frozen. Do not edit this file manually; automation will refresh it once the merge-conflict issues are resolved.
- If you add or rename cabinets in `madia.new/public/secret/1989/`, capture those notes elsewhere until the freeze is lifted.
