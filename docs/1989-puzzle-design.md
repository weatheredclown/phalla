## Level 50: The Cable Clash
- **Inspirational roots:** Channels the over-the-top theatrics of a late-80s wrestling spectacle featuring a hulking hero and ruthless network execs without naming names.
- **Anchor pieces:** A tension-rope arena with four color-coded corner posts and roaming showboating rivals.
- **Core mechanic:** Players route conductive cable segments across a 6×6 grid to connect their champion's home corner to the broadcast control hub. Cable paths cannot cross, and rivals break unsecured segments if they collide mid-turn.
- **Dynamic blockers:** Rivals execute signature movements—``Diagonal Drop`` (two diagonal tiles per turn) or ``Rope Rush`` (straight-line surges). Players must predict their telegraphed path each round.
- **Combo payoff:** Completing the circuit triggers a "main-event slam" burst, stunning adjacent rivals for one turn and awarding a style multiplier that carries into the next level.
- **Difficulty curve:** Starts with a single rival and static hazards, then introduces alternating current tiles that require alternating straight and corner pieces to maintain flow.

## Level 47: Velvet Syncopation
- **Inspirational roots:** A dimly lit lounge where a pair of piano-playing brothers bring on a chanteuse whose off-beat entrances electrify the room.
- **Anchor pieces:** Split-level piano keys that double as playable lanes, mirrored rhythm blocks for each brother, and a third syncopation rail that weaves between them.
- **Core mechanic:** Players juggle two mirrored note streams, striking color-coded keys in lockstep while threading the singer's off-beat sequences with precise timing windows.
- **Dynamic blockers:** Sustained chords force the brothers' lanes to hold notes across multiple beats, while "velvet slips" slide the syncopation prompts backward or forward a half-step.
- **Combo payoff:** Completing a beat where both brothers are perfect and the singer's syncopation hits cleanly unleashes a Showstopper flourish that clears the next two incoming measures.
- **Difficulty curve:** Opens with straight four-on-the-floor runs, then layers in staggered syncopation prompts, alternating sustain bridges, and split-octave hops that demand cross-hand play.
