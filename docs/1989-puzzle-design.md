## Level 50: The Cable Clash
- **Inspirational roots:** Channels the over-the-top theatrics of a late-80s wrestling spectacle featuring a hulking hero and ruthless network execs without naming names.
- **Anchor pieces:** A tension-rope arena with four color-coded corner posts and roaming showboating rivals.
- **Core mechanic:** Players route conductive cable segments across a 6×6 grid to connect their champion's home corner to the broadcast control hub. Cable paths cannot cross, and rivals break unsecured segments if they collide mid-turn.
- **Dynamic blockers:** Rivals execute signature movements—``Diagonal Drop`` (two diagonal tiles per turn) or ``Rope Rush`` (straight-line surges). Players must predict their telegraphed path each round.
- **Combo payoff:** Completing the circuit triggers a "main-event slam" burst, stunning adjacent rivals for one turn and awarding a style multiplier that carries into the next level.
- **Difficulty curve:** Starts with a single rival and static hazards, then introduces alternating current tiles that require alternating straight and corner pieces to maintain flow.
