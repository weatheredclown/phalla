## Level 50: The Cable Clash
- **Inspirational roots:** Channels the over-the-top theatrics of a late-80s wrestling spectacle featuring a hulking hero and ruthless network execs without naming names.
- **Anchor pieces:** A tension-rope arena with four color-coded corner posts and roaming showboating rivals.
- **Core mechanic:** Players route conductive cable segments across a 6×6 grid to connect their champion's home corner to the broadcast control hub. Cable paths cannot cross, and rivals break unsecured segments if they collide mid-turn.
- **Dynamic blockers:** Rivals execute signature movements—``Diagonal Drop`` (two diagonal tiles per turn) or ``Rope Rush`` (straight-line surges). Players must predict their telegraphed path each round.
- **Combo payoff:** Completing the circuit triggers a "main-event slam" burst, stunning adjacent rivals for one turn and awarding a style multiplier that carries into the next level.
- **Difficulty curve:** Starts with a single rival and static hazards, then introduces alternating current tiles that require alternating straight and corner pieces to maintain flow.

## Level 46: Speed Zone
- **Inspirational roots:** Spoofs the coast-to-coast outlaw cannonball runs where eccentric daredevils outrun police scanners with slapstick bravado.
- **Anchor pieces:** Mandatory checkpoint hubs and a tower of constantly tumbling High-Speed Dice that broadcast movement points and risk icons.
- **Core mechanic:** Probabilistic route planning across a stylized U.S. highway lattice—each roll reveals how far the car can surge and what hazard (sirens, blowouts, toll busts) will trigger if the player ends movement on a flagged node.
- **Routing challenge:** Players must lock in a safe path before the dice settle on a high-risk face, threading alternate highways, detours, and rest stops to avoid hazard nodes while still clearing every checkpoint in sequence.
- **Escalating threats:** Rival crews leak false traffic reports, shifting hazard tiles mid-turn, and patrol markers sweep ahead of the player whenever consecutive high-risk icons appear.
- **Actuation twist:** Earning a rare ``Bypass`` actuation cancels one checkpoint requirement, but forces an immediate reroute that consumes the current movement roll and shifts the risk icons for the next throw.
