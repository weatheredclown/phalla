# 1989 Puzzle Game Concepts

## Level 50: The Cable Clash
- **Inspirational roots:** Channels the over-the-top theatrics of a late-80s wrestling spectacle featuring a hulking hero and ruthless network execs without naming names.
- **Anchor pieces:** A tension-rope arena with four color-coded corner posts and roaming showboating rivals.
- **Core mechanic:** Players route conductive cable segments across a 6×6 grid to connect their champion's home corner to the broadcast control hub. Cable paths cannot cross, and rivals break unsecured segments if they collide mid-turn.
- **Dynamic blockers:** Rivals execute signature movements—``Diagonal Drop`` (two diagonal tiles per turn) or ``Rope Rush`` (straight-line surges). Players must predict their telegraphed path each round.
- **Combo payoff:** Completing the circuit triggers a "main-event slam" burst, stunning adjacent rivals for one turn and awarding a style multiplier that carries into the next level.
- **Difficulty curve:** Starts with a single rival and static hazards, then introduces alternating current tiles that require alternating straight and corner pieces to maintain flow.

## Level 45: Blaze
- **Inspirational roots:** A smoky, jazz-tinged tour through Louisiana politics that keeps the names changed but the intrigue intact.
- **Anchor pieces:** Legislative Bill tokens, the Governor's Desk and Signed Law endpoints, and the ever-simmering Blaze Starr scandal generator.
- **Core mechanic:** Arrange Paper Trail conduits on a bureaucratic flow board so the Bill travels cleanly from the Governor's Desk to the Signed Law while scandal paths divert into containment archives.
- **Dynamic blockers:** Scandal Point blocks continually emerge from Blaze Starr and must be rerouted using costly Political Capital before they spill onto the Bill's route.
- **Resource pressure:** Passing the Bill without contamination earns Political Capital, but every diversion or containment drain forces trade-offs between momentum and damage control.
- **Failure condition:** Any intersection between the Bill's conduit and a Scandal Point flow corrupts the legislation, resetting progress and imposing a scandal surge penalty.
