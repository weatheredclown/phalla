# Phalla Etiquette & Operations Manual

*A discerning player's companion to the grand game of suspicion.*

## Welcome to the Velvet Parlor

Phalla is a game of social deduction played in the low light of the internet's coziest lounge. Players gather, secrets simmer, and
nightly votes decide who leaves the conversation. This manual is your invitation to play with confidence, grace, and just enough
mischief.

## The Cast & Their Callings

- **Villagers** – Honest folk trying to survive long enough to expose the villains. Their strength is in voting together and
  comparing notes when the sun rises.
- **Mafia** – The shadowy few who collaborate in private each night to silence a rival. Their art is misdirection, charm, and
  plausible deniability.
- **Special Roles** – Seers, doctors, vigilantes, and other bespoke talents negotiated by the host. They operate under the same
  social contract but bring unique actions to each turn. When in doubt, ask the host for the exact phrasing of your powers.

## Rhythm of the Game

1. **Morning Roll Call** – The host publishes the previous night's events: who was silenced, what rumors surfaced, and any twists
   the rules demand.
2. **Daytime Debate** – Players talk openly on the game thread. This is the time for theories, accusations, spreadsheets, and
   calm persuasion. All votes must be posted publicly.
3. **Dusk Vote** – Before the deadline, every player casts a single vote to eliminate someone. Failure to vote invites the host's
   displeasure and may result in penalties or removal.
4. **Night Actions** – The mafia, special roles, and any other nocturnal talents submit their moves via private message to the host.
   Once processed, the next morning begins and the cycle continues until one faction stands triumphant.

## Voting Decorum

- **Bold Your Vote** – Highlight the name you are voting for so the host cannot miss it. Example: `Vote: PlayerName`.
- **One Vote at a Time** – Changing your mind is encouraged, but be sure to retract your previous vote before placing a new one.
- **Silence is Suspicious** – Habitual non-voters are not long for this game. If life intervenes, tell the host before the day ends.

## Communication Boundaries

- **Thread First** – All strategic conversations belong in the public thread unless your role explicitly permits otherwise.
- **Private Sanctuaries** – Mafia members and certain special roles may receive private channels arranged by the host. Treat them as
  sacred spaces: no copy-pasting of host messages, no screenshots, and no leaking beyond the invited guests.
- **Spectator Etiquette** – If you are eliminated, you may haunt the thread with tasteful commentary but never share insider
  knowledge. Remember: spoilers are gauche.

## Conduct Becoming of a Phalla Player

- **Respect the Host** – They are the arbiter, dramaturge, and occasionally the bartender. Their rulings are final.
- **Stay in Character** – Lean into the theme, write flavorful accusations, and keep the banter clever rather than cruel.
- **No Out-of-Band Schemes** – Do not weaponize real-life relationships, private chats outside approved channels, or technical sleuthing.
  Phalla is a game of persuasion, not packet sniffing.
- **Graceful Exits** – When eliminated, bow out with style. Do not reveal your role unless the host does so, and never share any
  information gained from private communications.

## Winning Conditions

- **Village Victory** – All mafia-aligned players are eliminated.
- **Mafia Victory** – Mafia members reach numerical parity with the remaining villagers.
- **Special Win States** – Some games include neutrals or hidden objectives. The host will describe them upfront; read carefully.

## Tips for Newcomers

- Keep a **vote log** so you can spot patterns and contradictions.
- **Ask the host** if any rule or power seems unclear. Clarity is polite.
- **Trust your gut**, but corroborate with evidence before campaigning for a vote.
- **Collaborate** with other villagers; the loudest voice isn't always right, but silence helps the mafia more than it helps you.

## Hosting with Panache

If you're stepping behind the curtain:

1. **Prepare the Script** – Outline roles, night actions, flavor text, and contingency plans before announcing sign-ups.
2. **Set the Schedule** – Publish clear deadlines for day and night phases, and stick to them.
3. **Keep Records** – Track every vote, action, and outcome. Your players will rely on you for accurate recaps.
4. **Moderate with Fairness** – Address rule infractions privately when possible, and publicly when necessary.
5. **Deliver the Finale** – When the dust settles, reveal roles, share fun statistics, and thank your cast. A graceful postmortem keeps
   the community coming back.

## House Policies of This Site

- **Account Responsibility** – Protect your login credentials and report suspicious activity to the administrators.
- **Spoiler Tags** – Use them when discussing external media or hidden game lore to avoid accidental reveals.
- **Accessibility Matters** – Format your posts with legible fonts, alt text for images, and high-contrast colors. A good mystery
  should never be inaccessible.
- **Archive Respectfully** – Game threads are part of our collective history. Do not delete your posts without consulting the host.

## Final Word

Phalla thrives on trust, drama, and a mutual agreement to keep the knives metaphorical. Carry yourself like the most interesting
person in the room, listen twice as much as you speak, and never forget that the real prize is another invitation to play.

*Now take a breath, adjust your cufflinks, and step into the conversation.*
