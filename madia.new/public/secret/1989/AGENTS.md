this is the set of arcade games based on movies from 1989
each game gets its own directory, then is added to the 1989 menu of games so that it is playable

Reference this project simply as "1989" in future prompts (e.g., "here's another 1989 game").
Each level should ladder upward from Level 50 to Level 1, pairing puzzle mechanics with thematic cues from 1989 cinema.
Use oblique level titles that allude to, but do not repeat, the exact film names.
games should be added to the 1989 arcade so that they can be played/replayed in any order

Shared animation/particle conventions:
- Use `particles.js` via `mountParticleField` for ambient cabinet effects when you need celebratory bursts (see `augmentum` and other neon-heavy stages).
- Keep palettes within the synthwave/neon spectrum defined in `particles.js` unless a level demands a bespoke theme; prefer extending the palette rather than writing new particle systems.
