# 1989 Puzzle Project Notes

This folder tracks coordination details for the "1989" Indy puzzle anthology.

- Reference this project simply as "1989" in future prompts (e.g., "here's another 1989 game").
- Each level should ladder upward from Level 50 to Level 1, pairing puzzle mechanics with thematic cues from 1989 cinema.
- Use oblique level titles that allude to, but do not repeat, the exact film names.
- games should be added to the 1989 arcade so that they can be played/replayed in any order
